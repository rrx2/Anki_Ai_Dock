## ✨ Features

  * **AI at Your Fingertips**: Embed any AI service (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.) in a dockable panel. If it has a URL, you can add it.
  * **Powerful Custom Prompts**: Create reusable prompts like "Explain `{text}` simply" to instantly query the AI with selected text from your notes.
  * **Effortless Paste**: Send the AI's response directly into any note field with a single click or a keyboard shortcut. No more manual copy-pasting\!
  * **Customizable Workspace**: Place the dock wherever you want (right, left, top, or bottom) and set up global shortcuts for your most common actions.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Select Text**: Highlight any text in an Anki field.
2.  **Send to AI**: Right-click (or use a shortcut) and choose one of your custom prompts. The addon will send your text to the AI.
3.  **Paste Response**: Once the AI responds, select the text in the dock and use the "Paste to Field" command to send it straight into your note.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize everything from Anki's main menu: `Tools > AI Dock Settings`.

From there, you can:

  * **Manage Prompts**: Add, edit, or remove your custom prompts.
  * **Add AI Services**: Add new AI websites or modify the default list.
  * **Set Shortcuts**: Configure your keyboard shortcuts for maximum speed.
