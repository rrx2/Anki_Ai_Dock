Tired of switching between Anki and your favorite AI? Anki AI Dock brings services like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude directly into your study workflow.

This addon embeds a handy web panel right into Anki's editor and reviewer, letting you generate, translate, or explain content for your flashcards without ever leaving the app. Speed up your card creation and supercharge your learning.

## ✨ Features

  * **AI at Your Fingertips**: Embed any AI service (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.) in a dockable panel. If it has a URL, you can add it.
  * **Powerful Custom Prompts**: Create reusable prompts like "Explain `{text}` simply" to instantly query the AI with selected text from your notes.
  * **Effortless Paste**: Send the AI's response directly into any note field with a single click or a keyboard shortcut. No more manual copy-pasting\!
  * **Customizable Workspace**: Place the dock wherever you want (right, left, top, or bottom) and set up global shortcuts for your most common actions.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Select Text**: Highlight any text in an Anki field.
2.  **Send to AI**: Right-click (or use a shortcut) and choose one of your custom prompts. The addon will send your text to the AI.
3.  **Paste Response**: Once the AI responds, select the text in the dock and use the "Paste to Field" command to send it straight into your note.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize everything from Anki's main menu: `Tools > AI Dock Settings`.

From there, you can:

  * **Manage Prompts**: Add, edit, or remove your custom prompts.
  * **Add AI Services**: Add new AI websites or modify the default list.
  * **Set Shortcuts**: Configure your keyboard shortcuts for maximum speed.
